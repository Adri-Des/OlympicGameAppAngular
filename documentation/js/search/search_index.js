version 18.0.3.\nDon't forget to install your node_modules before starting (npm install).\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.\nWhere to start\nAs you can see, an architecture has already been defined for the project. It is just a suggestion, you can choose to use your own. The predefined architecture includes (in addition to the default angular architecture) the following:\n\ncomponents folder: contains every reusable components\npages folder: contains components used for routing\ncore folder: contains the business logic (services and models folders)\n\nI suggest you to start by understanding this starter code. Pay an extra attention to the app-routing.module.ts and the olympic.service.ts.\nOnce mastered, you should continue by creating the typescript interfaces inside the models folder. As you can see I already created two files corresponding to the data included inside the olympic.json. With your interfaces, improve the code by replacing every any by the corresponding interface.\nYou're now ready to implement the requested features.\nGood luck!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
